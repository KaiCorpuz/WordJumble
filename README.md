# WordJumble
Kai Corpuz

Final Project for Object Oriented Programming

WordJumble is a GUI application that scrambles a word and the user has to guess the correct word. Right now, it displays a random, scrambled word. There is a textbox where the user can type their guess, and the program graphically displays whether or not the user got the word correct. I plan to implement a scoring system, and maybe another menu.

To build a similar application, the java.swing, and java.awt libraries are used to create the visual aspects of the program. For reference, the code for this program is located at https://github.com/KaiCorpuz/WordJumble

In your terminal, clone the repository to your computer, then be able to compile and run the program.

The majority of the program is original work. Alot of the functionality of the program, I learned how to do online, and implemented small bits of code that other people have created, but I neglected to reference them. I tweaked the code that I found however.

git clone https://github.com/KaiCorpuz/WordJumble
    javac *.java
        java WordJumble
