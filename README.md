# WordJumble
Kai Corpuz

Final Project for Object Oriented Programming

WordJumble is a GUI application that scrambles a word and the user has to guess the correct word. Right now, it displays a random, scrambled word. There is a textbox where the user can type their guess, and the program graphically displays whether or not the user got the word correct. I plan to implement a scoring system, and maybe another menu.

To build a similar application, the java.swing, and java.awt libraries are used to create the visual aspects of the program. For reference, the code for this program is located at https://github.com/KaiCorpuz/WordJumble

In your terminal, clone the repository to your computer, then be able to compile and run the program.

git clone https://github.com/KaiCorpuz/WordJumble
    javac *.java
        java WordJumble
